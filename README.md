Title : Analysis of the people's popularity and reason for its change during the time

Abstract:  With this dataset, we can get the popularity of a person by watching his number of quotations and the number of occurrences. After having identified the popularity of the people, we can determine why certain person loses or increases his populary during the time. For instance, discovering what event makes a person famous according to the quotations he made last year, and what event made lose popularity. We could analyze the impact on the popularity when a president finish his term or when he begins his term. Or for example to infer when something append (for example: Donald Trump became president) just looking at his popularity variation. So watching the poplarity can give us a lot of informations.

Alternate Abstract: We aim to study the 

Research Questions: (A list of research questions you would like to address during the project)
1. Categorization of news topics: We notice that we are able to extract topics of news items by some processing on the URLs provided. We show preprocessing for New York Times urls in this submission. Using these extracted topics, we aim to study what are the most popular topics trending in different times, who were the most popular speakers on any of the given topics and which news vendors are the most popular for a given topic.
2. Bias in Media: In this submission, we also have shown some preprocessing on textual representations. We aim to develop classification models on quotes which classify a quote's intent as positive or negative. Here, we aim to study for each category of news topics whether the media potrays a positive or a negative outlook. Further, we aim to study which news vendors or speakers are the chief proponents of each outlook in each topic. We also have some information about the speakers itself from the Wikidata dataset. From this, we can also study whether certain sections of the society are represented more than others? Is there a systemic suppression of certain sections of the society and we also learn the stance of each of these societies on different topics
3. Popularity of News: In this part, we aim to study what kind of news is more popular than others. Since for each quote we have the number of news vendors who published it, we can see which quotes and news topics and sentiment are more popular than others. We aim to study whether news vendors publish news topics and sentiments based on popularity. 


Proposed additional datasets (if any): (List the additional dataset(s) you want to use (if any), and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that youâ€™ve read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible.)

## Datasets
- Quotebank data from 2015 to 2020
- Wikidata with speaker informations
- Wikidata QIDs with labels and description

### How we manage the data
For the Quotebank data, we load directly with the help of pandas without unpack the files. We load with chunksize because the data is too big to fit in memory. So we need to handle the data by batch and merge the results (by adding in a list and concatenate this list of results to get the results dataframe). For the Wikidata with speaker information and the wikidata QIDs with labels and description datasets, we directly load all the data because there are much smaller than the first one. We merge these two datasets to get the speaker informations directly (without to look the QIDs in the wikidata QIDs dataset). The merge is done in `parse_speaker_attributes.ipynb`.
